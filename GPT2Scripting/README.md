# Raw Code Description: GPT-2 Benchmarking and Analysis

<font size="12">The following raw Python code provides a comprehensive benchmarking and analysis solution for fine-tuning large language models like GPT-2. It is designed to evaluate model performance and measure various statistics during the fine-tuning process. The code includes functionalities to fine-tune a language model, collect performance metrics, and generate visualizations for analysis. If you require a more cluster-friendly deployment method the official docker image of this code is hosted at: https://hub.docker.com/r/tlimato/gpt2_benchmark

**Key Features:**

1. **Fine-tuning Language Model:** The code leverages libraries like PyTorch, Transformers, and Accelerate to support fine-tuning of pre-trained language models. Fine-tuning allows users to customize the model for specific tasks or domains.

2. **GPU Support:** If compatible NVIDIA GPUs and CUDA are available on the system, the code takes advantage of GPU acceleration during fine-tuning and inference, reducing computation time significantly.

3. **Benchmarking and Metrics:** The code provides a function for fine-tuning the language model on user-defined datasets. It tracks performance metrics, such as training loss, evaluation metrics, and custom statistics, during the fine-tuning process.

4. **Graph Generation:** The code includes utilities for processing the collected performance metrics and generating informative graphs and plots. These visualizations help users analyze training progress, and convergence, and identify potential performance bottlenecks.

5. **Customization through Environment Variables:** Users can control benchmarking elements and fine-tuning parameters using environment variables. This allows for easy customization of the fine-tuning process according to specific requirements.

6. **Support for Custom Datasets:** The code includes utilities to process and load custom datasets for fine-tuning the language model. This enables users to work with their data and tasks efficiently.

7. **User-Friendly Execution:** The code includes a script that can be executed directly in a Python environment, making it user-friendly and accessible.

**How to Use:**

1. **Environment Setup:** Ensure that you have Python installed along with the required libraries specified in the code (PyTorch, Transformers, Accelerate, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.).

2. **Data Preparation:** Prepare your fine-tuning dataset in the required format and ensure it is accessible to the script.

3. **Fine-Tuning Configuration:** Customize the fine-tuning parameters in the code, such as batch size, learning rate, number of epochs, and model architecture.

4. **Execute the Script:** Run the Python script to initiate the fine-tuning process on the specified dataset. During execution, the code will collect performance metrics and print progress updates.

5. **Visualization and Analysis:** Once the fine-tuning process completes, the script will generate graphs and visualizations based on the collected metrics. Analyze the visualizations to gain insights into the model's performance.

The provided raw code is a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners working with large language models. It enables in-depth evaluation, analysis, and optimization of fine-tuning processes through comprehensive metrics and visualizations. Users can easily adapt the code to their specific NLP tasks and requirements by modifying environment variables and fine-tuning configurations.


Note: The raw code and Docker image (tlimato/gpt2_benchmark) were specifically designed and tested with the GPT-2 Large model and tokenizer from Hugging Face. The fine-tuning process was performed on the OpenWebText dataset. While the provided code can be adapted for other language models and datasets, the results and performance metrics mentioned in the benchmarking description are based on fine-tuning the GPT-2 Large model using the mentioned tokenizer on the OpenWebText dataset. Users are encouraged to refer to the original model documentation and customize the code accordingly for other models and datasets to ensure optimal results.
