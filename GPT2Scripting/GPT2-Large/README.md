GPT2-Large Chatbot
This repository contains code for training and using a GPT2-Large chatbot model on the OpenWebtext dataset. The model is implemented using PyTorch and utilizes the built-in Adam optimizer for training.

Model Details
Model: GPT2-Large
Dataset: OpenWebtext
Batch Size: 8
Context Length: 128 tokens per entry
Gradient Accumulation Value: 1
Gradient Clipping Value: 1
Loss Function: Cross Entropy Loss
System Requirements
The model is designed to run on a NVIDIA A30 (24GB Variant) GPU with 23.7GB utilization. It is recommended to have a compatible GPU and sufficient memory to train and use the model effectively.

Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Prepare the OpenWebtext dataset and preprocess it according to your requirements.
Configure the model parameters, optimizer, and other settings in the code.
Run the training script to train the GPT2-Large chatbot model on the OpenWebtext dataset.
After training, you can use the trained model to generate responses for user prompts or integrate it into a chatbot application.
