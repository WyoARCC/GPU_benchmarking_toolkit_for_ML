# Coqui-ai TTS

Most of the files in this folder are from [coqui-ai's TTS repository](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS). It was cloned from there on 2023/03/20. Additional files have been added to this repository to create a Singularity container that can be used to train the TTS and VOCODER models, an alternative Dockerfile, and helper scripts to run and log the outputs of training the model when launching the Docker container in a Kubernetes environment. For the specifics of how the implementation of the TTS and VOCODER models work please refer to Coqui-aiâ€™s repository. The goal of this repository is to provide a framework for benchmarking the performance of GPU hardware by training Machine Learning algorithms.
